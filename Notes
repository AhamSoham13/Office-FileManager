**** so no matter if a function is made with no arguments, 
if we are using it as a middleware, we have to pass req, res
 and next as arguments while calling that function with no arguments?
Is it some rule in node js?

==> ChatGPT
In Node.js and Express.js, middleware functions typically have a specific signature,
 regardless of how the middleware function itself is defined. 
 The signature for Express.js middleware functions is (req, res, next).

When you use middleware in an Express.js application, 
the framework expects these three parameters to be present in 
the middleware function. This is a convention established by 
Express.js for handling the request-response cycle.

Here's the common middleware function signature:

javascript

function middlewareFunction(req, res, next) {
  // Middleware logic here
}
The parameters req (request), res (response), 
and next (callback function to pass control to the next middleware) 
are essential for the middleware to interact with the request and 
response objects and to manage the flow of the application.

When you use a third-party middleware like Multer, you follow the same 
convention. Even if the Multer middleware itself is configured without 
explicitly taking parameters, when you use it in a route handler, you call 
it with (req, res, next):

javascript Code

const upload = multer({
  storage: FileStorage,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10 MB (adjust as needed)
  },
}).single('File');

const uploadHandler = (req, res, next) => {
  upload(req, res, (err) => {
    // Middleware logic here
  });
};

router.post('/upload', uploadHandler);
This convention ensures consistency in handling 
middleware across the Express.js framework and its ecosystem.
 It also allows middleware to seamlessly integrate into the 
 request-response flow, making it easier to compose and manage 
 different pieces of functionality in an Express.js application.
